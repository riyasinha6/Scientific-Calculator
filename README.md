Scientific Calculator GUI

Overview

This project is a GUI-based scientific calculator built using Java Swing. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations and scientific calculations such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and square roots.

Features

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.

Scientific Functions:

Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan.

Logarithmic Functions: log, ln.

Power and Root: ^, sqrt.

Bracket Support: Parentheses ( and ) for grouping expressions.

Clear Function: Reset the input.

Real-Time Evaluation: Displays results instantly upon pressing =.

Technologies Used

Java: Programming language used for development.

Swing: Java GUI toolkit for creating the graphical interface.

How to Run

Ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system.

Save the provided source code in a file named ScientificCalculator.java.
